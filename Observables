3 Observable Trends Based on Data:

1) As seen on the plot "Latitude vs. Temperature", it is noticeable that as you approach the equator, temperature rises,
 forming a parabolic curve the farther from the equator you travel
 
2) As seen in the plot "Latitude vs. Humidity", the humidity % varies more when the cities are located within the 
  Nothern and Southern tropics.
 
3) As seen in the plots "Latitude vs. Wind Speed", the wind speed mph sees the same trend as the "Latitude vs. Humidity" plot
  where the mph vary more when the city is located within the Northern and Southern tropics.
